## 📖 About V2rayFree

V2rayFree helps you safely and anonymously access the internet. It finds free proxy nodes shared on Telegram channels. These nodes update every 15 minutes, so you always have fresh options. Use the provided links with clients like V2ray to connect to these nodes.

This tool works for anyone who wants a free and private way to browse or unlock blocked content. You don’t need technical skills to start.

## 💻 System Requirements

- Operating System: Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12 or later, Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+ recommended)  
- Internet connection (a working, stable connection is necessary)  
- V2ray or any compatible client installed (see below)  
- Minimum 2 GB RAM  
- About 100 MB free disk space  

V2rayFree itself does not need much space. It mainly provides links you use in V2ray or similar software.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to download and use V2rayFree.

### 1. Visit the Download Page

Click the big badge at the top or this link:  
[https://github.com/xCtersReal/V2rayFree/releases](https://github.com/xCtersReal/V2rayFree/releases)  

This page contains the latest files and instructions.

### 2. Download the Latest Version

Look for files under "Assets" on the release page. Download the file suited for your device. Usually, these will be ready-to-use configuration files or packages to help you set up the connection.

If you need the V2ray client, you can download it from the [V2ray official site](https://www.v2ray.com). V2rayFree only provides proxy node links to use in clients like V2ray.

### 3. Open the Configuration File

Once downloaded, open the file with V2ray or another compatible client. This file contains the updated list of free proxy nodes.

### 4. Connect to the Internet Safely

Use V2ray or your client to connect through these nodes. Your connection will be anonymous, helping protect your privacy online.

## 📥 Download & Install

1. **Go to the release page:**  
   [https://github.com/xCtersReal/V2rayFree/releases](https://github.com/xCtersReal/V2rayFree/releases)  

2. **Download the file:**  
   Choose the latest release with the appropriate file format for your setup.

3. **Install or open the file:**  
   If you need to import it into V2ray, open your V2ray client and import the downloaded configuration.  

If you don’t have V2ray, get it from the [official website](https://www.v2ray.com).

## 🔧 How It Works

- The repository automatically fetches public free proxy nodes shared on Telegram.  
- Every 15 minutes, the list refreshes itself.  
- You receive updated addresses to connect through proxies anonymously.  
- It’s safe and helps bypass internet censorship or geo-blocks.

## ⚙️ Using V2rayFree with V2ray Client

1. Run your V2ray client.  
2. Import the configuration file downloaded from the releases.  
3. Choose the node you want to connect to from the client’s interface.  
4. Activate the connection.  

The client handles everything else. You now browse with a new IP address and encrypted traffic.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **I can’t connect after importing the configuration:**  
  Try switching to a different node inside the client. Nodes may sometimes go offline briefly.

- **The configuration file didn’t download:**  
  Check your internet or browser settings. Try a different browser if needed.

- **V2ray is unfamiliar to me:**  
  Visit the [V2ray documentation](https://www.v2ray.com/en/welcome.html) for a beginner-friendly guide.

## 🔐 Privacy and Security

V2rayFree itself only provides free proxy node addresses. The actual connection encryption and privacy come from your client, such as V2ray. Proxy nodes help mask your IP address and location.

Use proxy nodes responsibly and avoid accessing illegal content.

## 🌐 Additional Tips

- Use the setup on different devices by downloading the right client version.  
- Keep your client software up to date for best security.  
- Connect to nodes during less busy times for faster speeds.
